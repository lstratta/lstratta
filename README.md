# <div align="center">Luke Stratta: Kotlin/Spring Boot Engineer</div>

## What sound does a giant make when he laughs? _A-low-ha_... and welcome to my GitHub!

I am a software engineer currently working for [Digital Futures](https://www.digitalfutures.com) and about to move to the Netherlands. I am mostly working on building and designing APIs in Kotlin/Spring Boot.

**Here on GitHub, you'll find a bunch of projects that range from, educational resources that I build for myself, projects that I use to learn new concepts and techniques (so that I don't break production code), and some other random bits and bobs.**

Some projects that might interest you are:

### <div align="center">[Kotlin Testing](https://github.com/lstratta/kotlin-testing)</div>

This is the place I go where I need to try out anything to do with Kotlin. While I learn a lot of the stuff in my day-to-day work, if I need a simple Kotlin API environment to tear to pieces while trying to figure something out, this is the project for that.

### <div align="center">[Getting Started With Go](https://github.com/lstratta/getting-started-with-go)</div>
    
A project I put together for myself to learn different concepts within Go. Some of these concepts include Domain Driven Design, creating servers with Go, and connecting a Go API to MongoDB. I also added in a cheat sheet for specific Go concepts. I plan to add more as I use Go more.

### <div align="center">[GoLang Simple HTTP API](https://github.com/lstratta/golang-simple-http-api)    </div>
    
I also built an API to learn the basics of building an API in Go. This API connects to a MongoDB database and handles posts and comments. (I#'ll add something more exciting when I get to it.)

Some projects I intend to add are:

* A command line program 

* A terminal user interface program
